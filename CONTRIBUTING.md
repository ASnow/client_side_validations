## Submitting a new issue ##

If you need to submit a new issue please provide the following
information:

1. Version of ClientSideValidations
2. Version of Rails
3. Code snippet from your model of the validations
4. The form code from your template
5. The resulting HTML along with the script tag

If you want to ensure that your issue gets fixed *fast* you should
attempt to reproduce the issue in an isolated example application that
you can share.

## Making a pull request ##

If you'd like to submit a pull request please adhere to the following:

1. Your code *must* be tested. Pull requests without tests will be
   immediately closed. We will re-open if tests are added but that is
not ideal. Please TDD your code!
2. No single-character variables
3. Two-spaces instead of tabs
4. Single-quotes instead of double-quotes unless you are using string
   interpolation or escapes.
5. General Rails/Ruby naming conventions for files and classes
